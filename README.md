## Proposal: What Google Trends Tell Us

Problem: <br>
This study is aimed at analyzing the Google Search trends and correlating them with real-world
data via predictive analysis. The main idea is to study what Google Search data tells us about the
real world and then develop models to predict the outcome of an event. For example, Google
search trends can help predict the popularity of movies/video games by selecting appropriate
features. The prediction from various proposed predictive models will be analyzed and compared
to observations from other available sources. <br> <br>

## Dataset:
- Google Trend data to be obtained by using Python API <br>
- Datasets from other sources, depending on specific topics. For example, the popularity of
a movie can be ascertained from its box office collection which can be scraped from the
internet. <br>

### Proposed Solution and Real-World Application:
We aim to find the correlation between data obtained on a topic from google trends and other
datasets. One of the topics will be chosen for doing predictive analysis based on Google trends.
Dimensionality reduction techniques may be employed to select the optimum set of features, and
appropriate Machine learning models may be chosen to get the best accuracy of prediction. The
performance of the trained models can be assessed by comparing the predictions to other
available sources. For example, the prediction of the popularity of movies could be compared to
the IMDB movie ratings so that the accuracy of our prediction could be assessed.
The application of the proposed predictive models can be generalized to many other topics and
fields. A few examples will be demonstrated to show how this method works. With this method,
the information extracted from Google search frequencies could be used for gaining more
valuable insights into the subjects of interest. <br> <br>
- What is the correlation between google trends and real-world data?  <br>
- Can google trends provide some insight as to how popular a movie/video game might be?  <br>
- What are the best features of selected topics for predictive models?  <br>
- How to modify the model to get the best accuracy of prediction?  <br>
